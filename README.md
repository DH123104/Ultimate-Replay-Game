# Ultimate-Replay-Game
Ultimate Replay is a complete state-based replay system ideally suited to kill cams or action replay applications. 
Due to the state-based nature of the system, it is possible to view replays from any angle or even fly around the scene as playback occurs.

Recommended Uses:
• Action replays in sports of similar games.
• Kill cams / Death cams in shooting games (Demo included).
• Ghost vehicles in racing games (Demo included).
• Multiple angle replays where the same recording is viewed from a number of different vantage points in succession.
